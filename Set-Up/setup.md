Setting up Docker involves a few steps, and the exact process may vary depending on your operating system. Here, I'll provide a general guide for setting up Docker on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Install Docker on Linux:

1. Update your package manager:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
   ```

3. Add the Docker GPG key:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
   ```

4. Add the Docker repository:

   ```bash
   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
   ```

5. Install Docker:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
   ```

6. Add your user to the `docker` group to run Docker commands without `sudo`:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   newgrp docker
   ```

### Install Docker on macOS:

1. Download and install Docker Desktop from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

2. Follow the installation instructions provided for macOS.

### Install Docker on Windows:

1. Download and install Docker Desktop from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

2. Follow the installation instructions provided for Windows.

### Verify Docker Installation:

After installation, you can verify that Docker is correctly installed by running:

```bash
docker --version
docker run hello-world
```

The second command (`docker run hello-world`) will download a small test image and run it in a container. If everything is set up correctly, you'll see a message indicating that your Docker installation is working.

Keep in mind that the commands to install Docker may change over time, so it's always a good idea to refer to the official Docker documentation for the most up-to-date instructions: [Docker Installation Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
